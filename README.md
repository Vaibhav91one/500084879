## Description

- The backend was created first for this project.
- The backend consists of all the API calls that were required to implmenet.
- The things that I wanted to implement were to provide more efficiency.
- I also wanted to review the project but due to the time constraint I was not able to review and implement new features.
- Else the backend is working.
- The frontend required more time, so I had to drop it.
